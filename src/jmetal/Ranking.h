/**
 * This class implements some facilities for ranking solutions.
 * Given a <code>SolutionSet</code> object, their solutions are ranked
 * according to scheme proposed in NSGA-II; as a result, a set of subsets
 * are obtained. The subsets are numbered starting from 0 (in NSGA-II, the
 * numbering starts from 1); thus, subset 0 contains the non-dominated
 * solutions, subset 1 contains the non-dominated solutions after removing those
 * belonging to subset 0, and so on.
